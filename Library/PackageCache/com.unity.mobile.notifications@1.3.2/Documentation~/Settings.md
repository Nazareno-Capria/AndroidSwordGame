# Notification settings

From the **Notification Settings** window, you can control this package's behavior. Access this window from Unity's main menu: **Edit &gt; Project Settings &gt; Mobile Notifications**.

## Android

The following settings are available for Android notifications.

### Reschedule Notifications on Device Restart

By default, scheduled notifications are removed after the device restarts. To preserve scheduled notifications after the device restarts, you need to enable the **Reschedule Notifications on Device Restart** option. This adds the `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` permissions to your app's manifest.

### Custom Activity

You can enable the **Use Custom Activity** option to override the activity that opens when the user taps the notification. By default, your app will use `UnityPlayerActivity`.

### Custom Icons

Add custom icons your app can use for notifications. Whenever you schedule notifications in your script, use the icon ids you define in the list.

## iOS

The following settings are available for iOS notifications.

### Request Authorization on App Launch

You can configure your app to request authorization in one of two ways:

- From script (see this [example](iOS.html#authorization-request) for details).
- By enabling the **Request Authorization on App Launch** option, which makes the app automatically request the authorization when the user launches the app.

### Enable Push Notifications

You can enable the **Enable Push Notifications** options to add the push notification capability to the Xcode project.

You also need to enable this option to retrieve the device token from an [AuthorizationRequest](../api/Unity.Notifications.iOS.AuthorizationRequest.html).

### Include CoreLocation Framework

You must enable the **Include CoreLocation Framework** option to use the [iOSNotificationLocationTrigger](../api/Unity.Notifications.iOS.iOSNotificationLocationTrigger.html). This option adds the `CoreLocation` framework to your Xcode project.
